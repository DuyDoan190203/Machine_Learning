### Classification Assignment: Logistic Regression with Regularization
## Objective
 The objective of this assignment is to practice and apply key concepts of logistic regression in a classification problem. Throughout this assignment, we focus on using techniques such as feature selection, one-hot encoding, and regularization to build and evaluate machine learning models. Specifically, I aim to:
 - Train a logistic regression model on a dataset using categorical and numerical features.
 - Understand the impact of regularization in logistic regression by tuning the regularization parameter ùê∂.
 - Use feature elimination to identify the most and least useful features in a classification model.
 - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy.
## Key Learning Objectives
1. Understanding Logistic Regression:
 - Train and evaluate a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.
 - Learn how logistic regression works for binary classification tasks.
2. Handling Categorical Variables:
 - Preprocess categorical data using one-hot encoding, ensuring the model can work effectively with categorical inputs.
3. Feature Elimination:
 - Identify the least useful feature using a feature elimination technique.
 - Assess how removing certain features affects the model's accuracy, helping in understanding the importance of different features.
4. Regularization:
 - Experiment with different values of the regularization parameter C to find the optimal level of regularization.
 - Understand how regularization helps in controlling overfitting and improving the model's generalization on unseen data.
5. Model Evaluation:
 - Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy on a validation set.
 - Learn to compare models based on their performance and feature selection techniques.
